# ResortsAPI

# The goal of my project is to implement a minimal API that serves as the back end for a resort booking service capable of adding customers, resorts, and bookings that are all tracked and managed by a repository service layer.

# Technologies----------

# Framework - .net 9 - This is the latest .net Framework released by Microsoft and is the one I will be using in this project

# Entity Framework Core (EF Core) - An object relational Mapper (ORM) similar to Spring in Java that manages the dependency injections and lifetimes of the objects and allows for mapping C# objects to SQL databases using LINQ. Different to Entity Framework (EF) by allowing for cross platform programs as well as other benefits including better performance.

# Swagger - A great tool for testing Restful API by providing an interactive website when you .net run
